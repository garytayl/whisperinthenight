## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg Issues:
Ensure FFmpeg is installed and correctly added to your system's PATH.

### Dependency Problems:
If you encounter issues with `openai-whisper` or `pyannote.audio`, verify that they are installed by checking your virtual environment (if using one) or your systemâ€™s Python installation.

### Model Loading or Transcription Errors:
Check the logs output by the scripts for detailed error messages. Adjust the model parameters if necessary.

### Temporary Files:
Temporary files (like audio extracts and transcript JSON files) are generated during processing and cleaned up automatically after each run.

## Additional Notes

### Version Pinning:
While version numbers are not strictly required in `requirements.txt`, pinning them is recommended for production to ensure consistency.

### Contributions:
Contributions, suggestions, or bug reports are welcome. Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file if available.
